			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The first step in drawing a Gradient is drawing a line from north to south (or up to down). You then keep moving your Ebony pencil up and down until it is darker, but make sure to not press down too hard. You will build up on this line later on. The line should be (at most) a half centimeter wide. </p> 
			</div>  
		
			<h1 class= "Number"> 2. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Gradient-2.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The second step is to keep drawing by moving your Ebony pencil up and down but this time, you have to shade by slowly shifting the position of your pencil to the right as you move your pencil up and down. Make sure to put less pressure on the pencil to make sure you are drawing lighter!  </p> 
			</div>  
			

			<h1 class= "Number"> 3. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Gradient-3.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The third step is to use your shading stump or finger (preferably a shading stump) to make your gradient smoother. With a medium amount of pressure, move your shading stump/finger up and down while shifting towards the right. You will see that your lines are smoother and blended in.  </p> 
			</div> 

		
			<h1 class= "Number"> 4. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Gradient-4.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The fourth step is similar to step 2. You have to move your pencil up and down (starting from the darkest side) while shifting to the right, but this time, you need to put as little pressure on your pencil as possible. You will be drawing the lightest part of the gradient on the right, so make sure your shading is light!</p> 
			</div> 

			<h1 class= "Number"> 5. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Gradient-5.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The fifth step is to use your shading stump to shade in the lightest part of your Gradient. Move your stump up and down from a darker area and gradually move to the right. Make sure to have very little pressure as you shade towards the right. Try to make your lines as smooth as possible while shading. </p> 
			</div> 

			<h1 class= "Number"> 6. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Gradient-6.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 

			<div class= "Steplast"> 
				<p id= "text"> The sixth and final step is to smooth out the entire Gradient with your shading stump or finger. Keep moving the stump/finger up and down while shifting left and right in the Gradient. You can also even out all the sides of your Gradient this way and make it smoother. Finally, congrats for completing this tutorial!</p>
