			<!--Step 1 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 1. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-1.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The first step for this Still-Life Tutorial is to observe the shape of the mug in this picture. A drawing is always better with direct observation, so before drawing any sort of Still-Life piece, make sure to observe the object you are going draw. Try to differentiate the dark and light areas.   </p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 1 of Tutorial-->

			<!--Step 2 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 2. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-2.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The second step of this Still-Life Tutorial is to draw the outline of the mug and the table. Instead of using an Ebony pencil, you need to use a pencil (preferably a Ticonderoga pencil). Draw the outline of the mug VERY lightly, and do not draw anything except for the outline. </p> 
			</div>
			<!--End of Step 2 of Tutorial-->
	
			<!--Step 3 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 3. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-3.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The third step of this Still-Life Tutorial is to shade or draw in a Gradient along the right side of the mug with your Ebony pencil. The light in this picture is coming from the left, so the right side of the mug needs to get gradually darker. Remember to not make it too dark because you can always build up on it later.</p> 
			</div> 
			<!--End of Step 3 of Tutorial-->

			<!--Step 4 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 4. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-4.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The fourth step of this Still-Life Tutorial is to use your shading stump and smooth out your Gradient. No matter what, your lines are not going to be as smooth as the texture of the mug, so you need to smooth it out with a shading stump. Make sure to smooth it out in the same direction as the bottom of the mug. </p> 
			</div> 
			<!--End of Step 4 of Tutorial-->

			<!--Step 5 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 5. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-5.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The fifth step is to lightly outline the edges of the mug. Make sure that these lines are a little bit darker than your sketch, but not too dark! You can also outline the other edges of the mug as well in this step.  </p> 
			</div> 
			<!--End of Step 5 of Tutorial-->

			<!--Step 6 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 6. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-6.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Steplast"> 
				<p id= "text"> The sixth step of this tutorial is to make a Gradient within the cup. Make sure to shade in this Gradient alongside the curve of mug. This will give the inside dimension, and pay attention to how dark the inside is. The darker part of the Gradient is larger than usual uniform gradients. </p> 
			</div> 
			<!--End of Step 6 of Tutorial-->

			<!--Step 7 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 7. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-7.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The seventh step is to smooth out this Gradient with your shading stump. Again, blend out the lines with your shading stump to make it smooth, and make sure to blend in the direction of the curved inside.  </p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 7 of Tutorial-->
	
			<!--Step 8 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 8. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-8.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The eighth step is to lightly shade the left side of the mug. Since the light is coming from the left, the left side does not need a dark Gradient, but it should be shaded lightly to subtly show the outline of the mug against the background. Make sure that it is not too dark or too light!  </p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 8 of Tutorial-->
	
			<!--Step 9 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 9. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-9.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The ninth step is to lightly make another Gradient within the curve of the handle. Make sure to shade the Gradient in the direction of the handle for dimension or 3-D effect. Do not, however, make a Gradient for the entire handle and pay attention to where the light hits the mug.</p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 9 of Tutorial-->
	 
			<!--Step 10 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 10. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-10.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The tenth step is just like step 7, where you need to use your shading stump to make your lines/shading smoother. Blend out the Gradient on the handle, and as you blend, it will get smoother like the actual texture of the mug. Do not press to hard on the shading stump! </p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 10 of Tutorial-->
		
			<!--Step 11 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 11. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-11.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The eleventh step is to shade in the table area with a big Gradient. Make sure that it is uniform from the left and right side. You should draw it as close to the mug as possible, and it should be a bit darker than the mugâ€™s bottom.   </p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 11 of Tutorial-->
		
			<!--Step 12 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 12. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-12.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The twelfth step is smooth out the Gradient with your shading stump. Again, make sure that the blending is uniform on both sides and make the table look smooth!</p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 12 of Tutorial-->

			<!--Step 13 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 13. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-13.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The thirteenth step is to make the shadow of the mug on the table. For this, you need to make a Gradient in the shape of the mug. You start off shading right near the bottom of the mug, and then radiating outwards. It should not be longer than a centimeter on the bottom and right side of the mug. </p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 13 of Tutorial-->

			<!--Step 14 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 14. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-14.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The fourteenth step is to make the shadow darker by using a shading stump. As you blend out the shadow with your shading stump, it will get both darker and smoother looking.   </p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 14 of Tutorial-->

			<!--Step 15 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 15. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-15.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The fifteenth step is to draw a Wood Texture on the table, which can be found in the previous Texture Tutorial. Make sure that all your lines are visible and slightly darker than the Gradient on the table.    </p>
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 15 of Tutorial-->
	
			<!--Step 16 of Tutorial-->
			<h1 class= "Number"> 16. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-16.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The sixteenth and last step of this Still-Life Tutorial is to look at where the light hits the mug. There are certain parts where the mug has highlights, so you can create these highlights by erasing parts of the mug with the eraser on your Ticonderoga pencil. You can also make certain areas lighter by erasing.  </p> 
			</div>  
			<!--End of Step 16 of Tutorial-->
	
			<!--Final Product-->
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Still-17.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div>
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> And so, this is what your mug should look like after following the steps of this Tutorial.  </p>
