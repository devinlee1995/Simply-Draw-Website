			<h1 class= "Number"> 1. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-1.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The first step in drawing different Textures is to draw a Gradient. Remember, for a Gradient, you go from a dark shade to a lighter one. Make sure to not make the Gradient too dark because we need to draw over it for this Wood Texture. Many Textures look better with a Gradient lying under them.      </p> 
			</div>  

			<h1 class= "Number"> 2. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-2.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The second step in drawing this Wood Texture is to draw small, horizontal lines on top of the Gradient. These small lines need to be light, but dark enough to see against the Gradient. Make sure that they are parallel to the direction of the Gradient. You should also space them out throughout your Gradient.  </p> 
			</div>  

			<h1 class= "Number"> 3. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-3.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The third step is to connect these small lines. You connect them vertically by drawing multiple lines between them, but you have to make sure to use the flat side of your Ebony pencil. These lines should be thicker than the previous ones, and there should be NO space between them. They are not uniform in length. </p> 
			</div> 
	
			<h1 class= "Number"> 4. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-4.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The fourth step in drawing this Wood Texture is to repeat step 3 and connect all the lines that were drawn on top of the Gradient. Make sure that you connect them with a sideways 'U' formation to get a more realistic Wood Texture. You can also add little details such as darker small lines or little indents to make it rougher. </p> 
			</div> 

			<h1 class= "Number"> 5. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-5.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The fifth and final step of drawing this Wood Texture is to touch up your lines. You can darken the 'U' formations with a bit more shading until they are more noticeable or you can darken just a few lines. You may also blend the Gradient with the Texture more by blending with the flatter side of your shading stump.  </p> 
			</div> 

			<h1 class= "Number"> 6. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-6.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Steplast"> 
				<p id= "text"> The sixth step in drawing different types of textures (for this case, a Cross-hatch texture) is the same as step one. You (again) start off by drawing a simple Gradient. </p> 
			</div> 

			<h1 class= "Number"> 7. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-7.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The seventh step in drawing this Cross-hatch Texture is to draw diagonal lines. These lines need to be straight, and they cannot be too dark or too light. You should have a medium amount of pressure on your pencil when drawing these lines, and you should leave a bit of space between them. </p> 
			</div>  

			<h1 class= "Number"> 8. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-8.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The eighth step for this Cross-hatch Texture is to draw diagonal lines, but in the opposite direction. These lines should be exactly like the lines in step seven, and you should make sure to make them uniform.   </p> 
			</div>  

			<h1 class= "Number"> 9. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-9.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The ninth step for this Cross-hatch Texture is to add extra lines if the spaces are too big between them. It is never too late to touch up on this texture, and to make it look better, you can also make light diagonal lines with your shading stump. This Texture makes your drawing strokes more obvious and creates contrast. </p> 
			</div>  

			<h1 class= "Number"> 10. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-10.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The tenth step for drawing different Textures (in this case, a Fluffy Texture) is to draw repeated curls. This time, you are making a Gradient with these curls instead of lines. It is as if you are writing in cursive with many circles. This pattern should be a medium-dark grey shade and should not have spaces!   </p> 
			</div>  

			<h1 class= "Number"> 11. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-12.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The eleventh step for drawing a Fluffy Texture is to repeat the previous step, but you have to press down less on your Ebony pencil when drawing more curls. Make sure to build up or draw curls starting from the previous pattern. These curls need to be LIGHTER than the other ones.  </p> 
			</div>  
	
			<h1 class= "Number"> 12. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-13.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The twelfth step for drawing a Fluffy Texture is to repeat the previous two steps, and you have to press down even less pressure on your Ebony pencil while drawing more curls. Make sure to draw curls starting from the first pattern. These curls need to be LIGHTER than the other ones, and they should be VERY light.</p> 
			</div>  

			<h1 class= "Number"> 13. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-14.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The thirteenth step for drawing a Fluffy Texture is to follow the curled pattern with your shading stump and blend everything together. You can start blending from the top by drawing curls with your stump and you will eventually draw the lightest curls on the bottom as you move down. Do NOT press down hard on the stump. </p> 
			</div>  

			<h1 class= "Number"> 14. </h1> 
			<div id= "picture">
				<img src= "images/Texture-15.jpg" width = "400" height = "373"> 
			</div> 
			<div class= "Step"> 
				<p id= "text"> The Final and fourteenth step in this tutorial is to make sure the curls do not have too much space between them, and if they do, you can fill the spaces in with your shading stump. You can overlap curls to make a smoother Gradient, but do not overlap too much because it will become a regular, smooth Gradient.  </p>
